We want to help people learn from curated, quality technical content. Our community is essential to helping us achieve that. Welcome on board.

## Content

Welcome to the Kauri newsletter. Every two weeks we send a selection of the latest and our favourite content posted to the site, and from across the internet.

If you set interests or a role when you signed up for the newsletter, we will tailor content to suit you as much as possible.

### Contribute to our community
