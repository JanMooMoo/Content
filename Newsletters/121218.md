# December 12th 2018 - Learn to Build on Ethereum With Kauri

[Kauri](https://beta.kauri.io) aims to make building with Ethereum as straightforward as existing web 2.0 developer tools and frameworks. To help reach that goal, we are building a content platform for experts in the ecosystem to share their knowledge with those looking to grow theirs.

We're pleased to have heard from so many of you posting articles, interacting with us on Twitter (<https://twitter.com/kauri_io>) , and letting us know how much you enjoyed the last newsletter, so let's keep the momentum going with some more great content for you to read!

PS. Our friends at [Cellarius](https://cellarius.network) released a book of [blockchain-powered fiction](https://www.amazon.com/Whose-Future-Cellarius-Stories-I-ebook/dp/B07L5Z2J7B/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1544507892&sr=1-1&keywords=Cellarius) . Just in time for holiday reading!
