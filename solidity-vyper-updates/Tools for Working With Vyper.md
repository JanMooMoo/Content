# Tools for working with Vyper

While [Vyper](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) lacks the tools options Solidity has, there are still a few you might fid useful.

## Vyper Online Compiler

Vyper Online Compiler is an online editor for Vyper. Its web-based. It is currently in the experimental version. You can compile vyper codes, import vyper codes, save vyper codes to disk from it. It also has pre-written vyper codes that can serve as sample codes for you.

## Remix Vyper plugin

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) has a Vyper plugin for the language and compiler, enable it from the plugins section and off you go.

## Atom

If you want to use the atom editor to write vyper code, there is a vyper plugin that adds [syntax highlighting](https://atom.io/packages/language-vyper) on atom for you.

## Visual Studio Code

The [Vyper language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintinweb.vscode-vyper&ssr=true) can compile code, and integrates with [MythX](https://www.mythx.io/#faq) out of the box.

## Deployment Frameworks

You know when the development community has started to accept a language when it starts creating frameworks for it. Unsurprisingly Ethereum has a couple of options.
[Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) claims to be the most popular option, supporting compilation, testing, deployment, and dependency management.
[Embark](https://github.com/iurimatias/embark-framework) is similar, and also offers integration with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/).

## An Ecosystem of Constant Change

The blockchain space is in constant flux and thus a list of tools will not be comprehensive for the foreseeable future. If there'ss anything missing from this list, please add it to the comments below.
