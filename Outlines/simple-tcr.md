	2. Front-end
4. Limitations and improvement ideas
5. Wrap-up

## Motivation
One of the biggest powers of Ethereum is the ability to easily program a system with a desired behaviour of its users. Different patterns of such mechanisms were discovered and then implemented. Token-curated registry is one such mechanism. In short, it allows to create a network of incentivised curators to create a list based on some criteria. Such a flexible tool opens a lot of possibilities for aspiring dapp developers.

## Who should read this
Anyone who is interested in creating decentralized applications as well as those who want to learn more about game theory and mechanism design.
The article will include code samples in Solidity and JS and will require a moderate technical background.
