# ETHBerlin 2019

## Intro

## Compared to other events

I go to a lot of events, actually, at times, I go to too many, frequently experiencing a certain level of boredom and jadedness with conferences. I say this just in case I come across as overly negative, I don't mean to be, I just go to way too many events.

I noticed something in some of the talks I attended throughout the week, this could have just been the conferences I went to, or maybe it's a valid general comment. While many tech events aimed at developers (and you could argue that web3summit, ETHBerlin etc are not) have talks that follow the "Here's how we built a project and the challenges we faced" approach, web3 event talsk tend to follow the "we built this, please use it" format. This may say more about the state of the ecosystem than anything else. Projects such as Kubernetes, Java, or React are so mature and well used, that they have enough people using them and don't need to promote themselves as directly, as others do it for them. Generally the "use our stuff" talks are reserved for sponsors, and maybe I have a tendenacy to wander into web3 events subcociously, who knows. However, aside from some core technologies (Solidity, the EVM itself etc), the myriad of tools people are building are rarely mentioned, or only in passing. It's not that often you see an ifrastructure diagram, or some code on screen. Someone did point out to me that web3 technologies tend to be more research-based, and that as maybe the implemetation isn't that different from "traditional" development, it's not worth mentioning.
