I'm **Billy Rennekamp**, I work for a couple big projects like [**Cosmos Network**](https://cosmos.network), the creators of Tendermint and the Internet of Blockchains, [**Gnosis**](https://gnosis.pm), a prediction market platform and the creators of the Gnosis Safe and the DutchX decentralized exchange software. I also build on a couple smaller projects like [**Clovers Network**](https://clovers.network), a game for generating rare art, [**MemeLordz**](https://memelordz.com), a curation market of memes (/r/MemeEconomy on the blockchain), [**ENS Nifty**](https://ensnifty.com), a service for wrapping ENS domain names in NFTs so they can be sold on marketplaces like opensea and [**Doneth**](https://doneth.org) a shared wallet for open source projects.
