## Step 10: Verify Contracts on Etherscan

Now you are able to see your contracts on the block explorer [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io). What you don't see is the  code you used to generate the contract. To add that and provide a user the security of knowing what this code does (and to provide a place to track the token), you can verify the contract. The easiest method is with a flattener, which imports every referenced file and combines them into one single file.

A good option is "[truffle-flattener](##)" because it works with the truffle framework in mind. We installed it earlier so you should be able to use it from your project directory and generate the files. Begin by making a folder to store the output, and then flatten the files.

```bash
mkdir flat
npx truffle-flattener contracts/Token.sol > flat/Token.sol
npx truffle-flattener contracts/Metadata.sol > flat/Metadata.sol
```

<!-- TODO: Check -->

Now visit the etherscan.io endpoint for your deployed contracts. You may need to scroll back up to your deploy messages which  tell you the address of your contract. Use this address and go to `https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/_CONTACT_ADDRESS_`

Open the "Code" tab and click "Verify And Publish".  Enter "Token" under contract name, and select the compiler version you used. You can confirm the compiler in the _./build/Token.json_ file by searching for "network". This shows you a record of the deployment of your contract relevant to each network (rinkeby is number 4) alongside the compiler version. Mine is `0.5.0+commit.1d4f565a`, so I select that on the drop down on etherscan. I turn "Optimization" to off, since by default truffle does not run the compiler with optimization turned on. Then copy and paste the contents of _./flat/Token.sol_ into the text box.

Confirm you are not a robot and then click "Verify and Publish". If everything worked you see a success message like this:

If you click your address link you now see that your contract has a lot more information on it:

Now via the "Write Contract" tab you can directly access the "mint" function, and if your metamask has the same seed phrase as your deploy account you can mint from the browser. Since your contract is a compliant ERC-721 you can also look at it via the lens of a token account. To do so, change the word "address" in the URL to "token", for example [https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_)

You may notice it doesn't have a name yet, or is called ERC-20 even though it is ERC-721, this is because there hasn't been any transactions yet and etherscan isn't that smart.

End of part 1, celebrate by minting a token or two
