## Step 1: Setup Environment

I'm using `node v9.11.2` and `yarn v1.7.0` for this tutorial. NPM and other versions of node should, work just a heads up. ☝️

First, make a new project folder somewhere:

```bash
mkdir ./workshop && cd ./workshop
```

I have a [truffle box](https://kauri.io/article/2b10c835fe4d463f909915bd75597d6b/v1/truffle-101-development-tools-for-smart-contracts) called "truffle box" preinstalled with [solium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solium), [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist), [zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org), migrations, tests, and more.

Unbox truffle shavings and install dependencies using `npx` (included with recent versions of npm).

```bash
npx truffle unbox okwme/truffle-shavings

yarn
```

Create a _.env_ file and open the project in your favorite editor to add the different network specific mnemonic phrases and Infura API key:

```conf
TRUFFLE_MNEMONIC=word1 ... word12
GANACHE_MNEMONIC=word1 ... word12
TESTNET_MNEMONIC=word1 ... word12
INFURA_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
```

If you don't have an account with Rinkeby ETH you can use the account I made for this tutorial. Be careful as if you're using it at the same time as someone else and try to run transactions, there will be nonce collisions which prevent some transactions from going through.

```conf
TESTNET_MNEMONIC=flash gravity sister tip question story slam square resemble intact require voyage
```

And you're welcome to use the Infura key I made for this tutorial:

```conf
INFURA_API_KEY=85939c42711147b291a40dc3a77177f8
```

Check the boilerplate contracts compile, deploy and pass the dummy test locally:

```bash
$ yarn test --network develop
Using network 'develop'.

Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Sample.sol...
        Sample deployed at: 0x345cA3e014Aaf5dcA488057592ee47305D9B3e10


  Contract: Sample
        68922 - Deploy sample
        -----------------------
        68,922 - Total Gas
    Sample.sol
      ✓ should pass


  1 passing (171ms)
```

And to make sure our testnet account has gas let's try rinkeby

```bash
$ yarn test --network rinkeby
Using network 'rinkeby'.

Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Sample.sol...
        Sample deployed at: 0x345cA3e014Aaf5dcA488057592ee47305D9B3e10


  Contract: Sample
        68922 - Deploy sample
        -----------------------
        68,922 - Total Gas
    Sample.sol
      ✓ should pass


  1 passing (171ms)
```

<!-- TODO: Is this needed? -->

Create a new repo on github, gitlab or bitbucket and add our boilerplate

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Step 1: Setup Environment'
git remote add origin git@github.com:{username}/{repo}.git
git push -u origin master
```
