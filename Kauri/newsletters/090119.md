# Learn to Build on Ethereum With Kauri

Welcome to 2019, and what promises to be an interesting year in the Crypto and Blockchain space. Last year [we announced our $25,000 grant program](https://beta.kauri.io/article/b5c15961f13d4112bc82f6edb6fd3a75) for funding technical content thanks to the Ethereum Foundation. In the spirit of reflection and looking forward, we produced a round up of what we've done with the grant so far, and how you can be involved, [read that post](https://beta.kauri.io/article/56de1edb7c4746568c608f0de24f75fb/v1/january-2019-ethereum-grant-update) and contact us if you're interested in sharing your knowledge.
